Easy measures: Maintainability.

	M9:  # of methods that are directly using fields from other classes
	
	M10: # of variables declared public
	
	M11: # of functions that have a fan-out â‰¥ 10
		The fan-out is calculated by summing up the number of
		called functions (methods) and the number of member
		variables set.
	
	M14: # of functions with > 2% commented out instructions
	
	M15: # files > 1000 LOC 
	
	M17: # of GO TOs, CONTINUE, and BREAK outside the switch
	
	M19: # of methods with â‰¥ 7 data or file operations
	
	M20: # functions passing >= 7 parameters
