All Measures:
DONE Measure 1: # functions that span layers
DONE Measure 2: # of layer-skipping calls
DONE Measure 3: # of layers (threshold 4 ≤ # Layers ≤ 8)
Measure 4: # files that contain 100+ consecutive duplicate tokens
Measure 5: # of unreachable functions
Measure 6: # of classes with inheritance levels ≥ 7
Measure 7: # of classes with ≥ 10 children
IGNORE Measure 8: # of instances of multiple inheritance of concrete implementation classes (threshold > 1)
DONE Measure 9: # of methods that are directly using fields from other classes
DONE Measure 10: # of variables declared public
DONE Measure 11: # of functions that have a fan-out ≥ 10
Measure 12: # of objects with coupling > 7
Measure 13: # of cyclic calls between packages
DONE Measure 14: # of functions with > 2% commented out instructions
Measure 16: # of instances of indexes modified within its loop
DONE Measure 17: # of GO TOs, CONTINUE, and BREAK outside the switch
Measure 18: # functions with cyclomatic complexity ≥ a language specific threshold (table to be inserted)
Measure 19: # of methods with ≥ 7 data or file operations
DONE Measure 20: # functions passing ≥ 7 parameters
Measure 21: # of hard coded literals except (-1, 0, 1, 2, or literals initializing static or constant variables)
